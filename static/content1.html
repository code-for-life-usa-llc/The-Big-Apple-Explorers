            <h1>Times Square</h1>
            <h2 id="times">Lastly, the most popular spot of NYC is Times Square. Times Square begain in 1898, originally known as
                Long
                Acre Square. It was orginally meant for William H. Vanderbilt's American Horse Exchange. Eventually the
                theater buisness arrvied in town and it began booming. However, during the Great Depression and World
                War 2,
                theaters were struggling so they began promoting explicit imagery to gain more customers. The drug trade
                also grew in the 70s around this area. However, it has become much safer and now its a place of dazzling lights, theater, and
                oppurtunity. Times Sqaure, located on 42nd Street has now become the capital of Broadway and the Theater
                sector of NYC. </h2>
